* Khaustoff dots
** What is this
What is this? These are my working configs. I use nixos, but everything is not done through the home manager,
	*THE CONFIGS ARE ABSOLUTELY COMPATIBLE WITH ALL OTHER SYSTEMS,* so they can be used on nixos and gentoo and arch.

And you can see my wallpaper collection.

** Recommendations 
 [[https://github.com/LGFae/swww][Swww]] for wallpapers.
 Zathura-pdf-mupdf or zathura-pdf-poppler for correct operation of zathura (if you don't use nixos).

** Install
Okay, everything is simple here, you need to copy the repository, go to this directory and run the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
  cp -r ./config/* ~/.config/
  mv ~/.config/musikcube-themes ~/.config/musikcube/themes 
  cp -r ./Wallpapers/ ~/
#+end_src

Optionally look at my wallpaper colletion.
