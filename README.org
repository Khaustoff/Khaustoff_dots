** What is this
What is this? These are my working configs. I use nixos, but everything is not done through the home manager,
	*THE CONFIGS ARE ABSOLUTELY COMPATIBLE WITH ALL OTHER SYSTEMS,* so they can be used on nixos and gentoo and arch.

** Recommendations
 [[https://github.com/neovim/neovim][Neovim]] 0.10+ for correct operation of all plugins.
 [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] 29+ ([[./emacs_config/README.org][more details in the readme for it]]). 
 [[https://github.com/LGFae/swww][Swww]] for wallpapers.
 Zathura-pdf-mupdf or zathura-pdf-poppler for correct operation of zathura (if you don't use nixos).

** Install
Okay, everything is simple here, you need to copy the repository, go to this directory and run the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
  cp ./config/* ~/.config/
  # for emacs in the readme for it (look above)
  cp ./Wallpapers/ ~/
#+end_src

Optionally look at my wallpaper colletion.
